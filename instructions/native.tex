If your machine is not supported, you can get a native Zephyr installation by following the Zepyhr \href{https://docs.zephyrproject.org/\zephyrversion/develop/getting_started/index.html}{Getting Started Guide}.
Beware, that you must ensure to checkout the right Zephyr version. Replace the \mono{west init \~/zehpyrproject} command from the Getting Started Guide with the following command.

\begin{lstlisting}
west init --mr v@\zephyrversion{}@ zephyr_@\zephyrversion{}@
\end{lstlisting}
