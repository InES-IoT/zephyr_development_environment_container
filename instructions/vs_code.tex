\section{VS Code Configuration}

The following instructions explain how to configure VS Code for Zephyr development inside a WSL distro.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Install the \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl}{WSL extension}
  \item Connect to WSL distro using the blue button on the bottom left (\emph{Connect to WSL using Distro...})
  \item Clangd searches for a compilation database file (\mono{compile_commands.json}) in the parent directories of source files and also in subdirectories named \mono{build} (see \href{https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#project-setup}{documentation}).
    If you build your project in \mono{/tmp/build}, clangd will not find the database file.
    Run the following command to create a link to the compilation database file such that clangd can find it (adapt the paths as needed).

\begin{lstlisting}
@\cmdinwsl{}@ ln -s `
  /tmp/build/compile_commands.json `
  /mnt/c/Users/neye/Downloads/zephyr_labs/
\end{lstlisting}
  \item Create a file named \mono{.clangd} in the same location where you created the link to the compilation database file.
    Copy the following to this file (make sure that the indentation is the same as here).

\begin{lstlisting}
CompileFlags:
  Remove:
    - '-fno-printf-return-value'
    - '-fno-reorder-functions'
    - '-mfp16-format=ieee'
\end{lstlisting}
  \item Install the \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd}{LLVM clangd} extension
  \item Open the project folder via \emph{File} $\rightarrow$ \emph{Open Folder...} $\rightarrow$ \mono{/mnt/c/...}
\end{itemize}
